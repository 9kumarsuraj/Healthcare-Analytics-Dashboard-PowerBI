##  Why This Project Stands Out

- **End-to-End Analytics**: Covers finance, HR, and patient service views in one solution  
- **Goal-Driven Pages**: Each dashboard is aligned with a business goal (billing, care quality, demographics)  
- **Clean & Consistent UI**: Easy to interpret for non-technical healthcare stakeholders  
- **Interactive Design**: Built with slicers, drill-downs, and conditional formatting  
- **Realistic Use Case**: Simulates hospital admin dashboards used in real-world healthcare organizations
